## Reminiscence

Her fluttering hair,   
soaked⁣  
in the ocean air.   ⁣
⁣

Distant smiles o'er⁣  
a squeal of⁣     
surprise⁣   
as the sea waves⁣   
rise⁣     
and recede.      ⁣
⁣

The sudden glimpse    
of a faraway ⁣    
memory⁣    
like⁣    
a gentle sea breeze   
to put a disturbed mind⁣   
at ease.⁣
