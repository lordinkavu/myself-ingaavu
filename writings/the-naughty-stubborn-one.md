## The naughty, stubborn one.

She was the naughty, stubborn one. That's what everyone said. Unsurprisingly, she ran away from me on every opportunity and all my efforts in making a conversation went down the drain.

With all my plans spoiled and time to spare, I asked her if she could tell me a story and to my surprise she started narrating one spontaneously as if she had been anticipating it. One by one several stories unfolded and I sat with her, listening earnestly. With time, she got comfortable with me and her stubbornness vanished. The fictional tales gave way to memories of joyful times she spent with her siblings. One could feel a tinge of sadness in her words and longing in her eyes. She talked at length about her family and people she cared for. She spoke about the time she asked her grandmother to prepare some specialities for her dear friend Vani who had lost her mother and often visited her. She also recalled the day in which she, along with her sister, tried to prepare the day's meal while their father was sleeping after a tiring day and how on seeing this he took them out and bought them ice-creams.

What surprised me the most was the maturity in her way of speaking and  her understanding of the unfortunate realities she continues to face. What consoles me is that there is hope left within her. She looks forward to living in a fully furnished house with her family. She dreams of becoming a doctor one day to help her family and many such more.

All I could do was to give her encouragement and support. She was seen as the naughty, stubborn one, but not any more.
