## Alternate Reality

Once upon a time  
lived a pretty little⁣  
girl,⁣  
who would ⁣  
close her eyes and⁣  
wish to fly. ⁣  
High ⁣  
and high ⁣  
and high. ⁣
⁣

The purple sky, ⁣  
on a mid winter night. ⁣  
" A silver lining! " ⁣  
She gasps in delight⁣  
her eyes so bright, ⁣  
golden and white. ⁣
⁣

A vivid dream ⁣  
of a mystic land. ⁣  
The rustic charm ⁣  
of the mountain side. ⁣  
A familiar face,⁣  
a helping hand. ⁣  
Waiting to be held⁣  
in a land so close⁣  
and yet so far. ⁣
