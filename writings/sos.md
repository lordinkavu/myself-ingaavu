## SOS

I'm the eye of a tornado,   
I roar and rage & I reign.   
I'm nature's fateful fury,⁣⁣  
Behold, my mighty glory. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣

You burn, you rip down,  
you presume all is yours.  
I sit back and I ponder, 'n'  
I unleash fire and thunder. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣

I'm the eye of a tornado,  
I roar and rage & I reign.⁣⁣
⁣⁣

You crush, you drill deep,  
you destroy all that's mine.⁣⁣  
I'll linger and I'll creep, I'll  
come down when it's time. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣

I'm the eye of a tornado,  
I roar and rage & I reign.⁣⁣  
I'll rise from your shadow,⁣⁣  
and then _oh boy_,  
there'll be no tomorrow.
